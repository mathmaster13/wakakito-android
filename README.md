# wakalito-android

A work-in-progress [wakalito-ios](https://github.com/tbodt/wakalito-ios) port.

Get a built APK [here](https://mathmaster13.github.io/wakalito-android).

## Known Issues

- Keyboard may not display correctly in landscape mode.
- When deleting long words, one character too many may be deleted, because a hard keyboard signal is sent.
- Lag when deleting, because a hard keyboard signal is sent.
- The box displaying the sequence you are currently typing is transparent.
- The return key sends a hard keyboard "ENTER".

## Unimplemented Features

- The app itself, which allows you to see a chart of all radical sequences allowed.
- linja sike is not installed, so a text-based approximation is used for now.
- The keyboard color scheme is not finalized, and its layout is not very polished.
  - As such, no dark mode yet.
